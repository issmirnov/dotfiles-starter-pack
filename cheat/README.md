# Cheats

Config in [zsh/config/cheat.sh](../zsh/config) points the `cheat` command here.
You can view these files as is, or install the
[cheat](https://github.com/cheat/cheat) [latest release](https://github.com/cheat/cheat/releases/latest) and use it natively.

## OSX Install

`brew install cheat`

## Linux Install

DO NOT USE the `sudo pip install cheat` command, as that will install cheat v2.

Instead, grab the [latest release](https://github.com/cheat/cheat/releases/latest) and stick it in /usr/local/bin
